        <p>I am a mechanical engineer. I learned some programing languages in university ten years ago.
            to be precise one course in c that's it. However, I have been following some youtube courses and kind of get
            how to deal with python. </p>
        <p>Programing for me is kind of relaxing at the end of the day or during the weekend I will forget about time
            and do what i enjoy 'problem solving'. This is my first website I am starting to learn a new thing
            web development. I will try to create some page were i can show all of my project in programing languages here.
            maybe i will share my experience as will</p>
